## 🖥️ Project Overview

This project is created as part of the **Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & Page Design Internship Task**.  
It demonstrates the use of **Bootstrap 5 components** to design clean, modern, and responsive web pages.

The project includes **three fully responsive pages**:

1. **Home Page** → Navbar, Hero Section, Feature Cards, Footer
2. **About Page** → Information section and Service Cards
3. **Contact Page** → Functional contact form (Formspree), Info Card, and Footer

## 🧩 Components Used

- **Navbar** (from Bootstrap Examples)
- **Hero Section** (custom layout using grid & img-fluid)
- **Cards** (features, services)
- **Forms** (contact page)
- **Modal** (optional CTA on Home Page)
- **Footer** (custom minimal design)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)**
- **Formspree** – for contact form submissions
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and hosting
- **VS Code** – code editor

## 🧠 How I Built This (Step-by-Step)

1. Explored [Bootstrap Examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/) to study UI patterns.
2. Created file structure → `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `css/styles.css`.
3. Added Bootstrap 5 via CDN links in all pages.
4. Designed **Home Page** with Navbar, Hero, Cards, and Modal CTA.
5. Designed **About Page** with info and service cards.
6. Built **Contact Page** with working form (Formspree endpoint).
7. Added consistent styling using Bootstrap utilities and a few custom CSS tweaks.
8. Tested responsiveness on desktop, tablet, and mobile using Chrome DevTools.
9. Deployed website using GitHub Pages (or Netlify).

## 🤖 Use of External Help / AI

I used the following tools for guidance:

- **Bootstrap Docs** (for structure & classes)
- **ChatGPT** (for step-by-step guidance, code corrections, and explanation)
  - Used to understand Bootstrap grid, fix mobile image issue, and write README.
  - Did **not** copy entire example pages — all components were remixed manually.
